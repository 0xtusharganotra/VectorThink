This is the frontend for VectorThink, your personal AI-powered second brain. VectorThink helps you store, organize, and retrieve information effortlessly.

## ‚ú® About The Project

VectorThink is an intuitive and powerful platform designed to serve as your secure, AI-powered digital second brain. It transforms your raw, stored information into readily accessible knowledge, allowing you to manage, organize, and effortlessly interact with your personal content corpus.

### Key Features:

- **Intelligent & Factual Q&A**: Our assistant leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide answers grounded only in your stored content, eliminating the guesswork and hallucinations common in general-purpose LLMs.

- **Personalized Search Security (Multi-Tenant)**: Every search is filtered by user ID. Your queries only run against your own data, ensuring complete privacy and security in a multi-user environment.

- **State-of-the-Art Indexing**: Content is converted into rich, 3072-dimensional vector embeddings using Google's Gemini embedding model (gemini-embedding-001), ensuring high semantic accuracy when retrieving complex information.

- **Intuitive Content Management**: Easily store and organize various content types (notes, links, etc.) through a clean user dashboard.

- **Session-Based Chat**: Conversation is managed per session with a clear 20-message limit to maintain speed and resource efficiency.

- **User Authentication**: Secure sign-in and sign-up using JWT and strong password hashing using bcrypt.
